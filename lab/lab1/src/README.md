## Introduction
isAnagram.java is a program determining if the two strings input by the user are anagram. The program compares the hashmap of the character and frequency of each word and see if the two hashmaps are the same.

isRotation.java is a program determining if the the second string is the rotation of the first string. The program will compute all the possible rotations of the first string and compare if the second string is one of them.

## Installation

compile the program by using ```javac``` and run the program by using ```java```

For example:
```sh
$ javac isAnagram.java
$ java isAnagram
```

## Usage

Follow the prompt of the program. Note that it doesn't matter the input sequence for isAnagram but is does matter for the isRotation program. isRotation accepts the first string as the target and the second string as the potential rotation.
